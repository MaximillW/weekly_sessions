# Week 6 - Burp and Web apps
In this weeks session we will be looking at hacking web applications and using Burp Suite. 
To do this we'll be using your Kali VMs which should already have Burp Suite installed by default, and our web application target will be OWASP's Juice Shop.

Follow through steps 1 & 2 to get setup for the challenges:

1. How to deploy Juice Shop
2. How to configure Burp

Have a go at the challenges below! If you get stuck or just don't know how, try a bit of google-fu, or look through our handy spoilers for a walkthrough:

Challenge 1 - Find the Scoreboard
Challenge 2 - Leave the Juice Shop a 0 star rating
Challenge 3 - Get yourself a juicy coupon code from the Juice Shop support bot
Challenge 4 - Register a new admin user for the shop
